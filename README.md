# Project # 2 to get articles from New York Times Top Stories API

Project was made using ajax to get the JSON file from the API then parsed using JavaScript/jQuery to build article div.

Article grid is styled using flex. Also set up animations for grid and header using css animations.

Difficult Points:
  Learning some new uses of gulp and getting it to compile properly was a challenge. It took me quite a while to get my file structure organized and compiling properly.
  
  Finalizing the project took a while because of tiny little extra additions that I had  to go back fix or add after I thought I was already done.
  
Final Overview: Fun project, good mix of JS and gulp learning to make the required functionality.
